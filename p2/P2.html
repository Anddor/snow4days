    <h2 id="2">2. Administrative details</h2>

    <p>Client name: Snow4Days Inc.</p>

    <p>Website name: Snow4Days</p>

    <p>Contact person: Mike Hawke</p>


    <h2 id="3">3. Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>

    <p>The purpose is to increase revenue by getting more customers. The audience are experienced skiers and snowboard enthusiasts around the world. An informative website will help them make the right choice - picking Snow4Days as their destination.</p>


    <h2 id="4">4. Navigation Structure</h2>

    <p>Every site will be accessible from one another through the navigation bar. Everything will not be shown at once, as some of the locations ski4Days is offering will be under a drop-down menu in the navigation bar, so the user will have to hover their mouse over the “Locations” button to view the different offerings. THe footer will be accessible through the footer. </p>
    <img src="images/nav_structure.png" alt="Illustration of how you can navigate through the site. Every site can be reached from everywhere.">

    <h2 id="5">5. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>

    <p>From the project requirements we have decided to have a clean and modern look, with emphasis on pictures. The page layout and appearance has been made with this in mind.</p>


    <h3>Colors</h3>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Text color</td>

            <td>black</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Link color (hover)</td>

            <td><span style="color:#349292">#349292</span>
                (<span style="color:#94D7D7">#93D7D7</span>)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Visited link color (hover)</td>
            <td><span style="color:#D49F36">#D49F36</span>
                (<span style="color:#F4BF56">#F4BF56</span>)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Background color</td>
            <td style="background-color: #FAFEFE">#FAFEFE</td>
        </tr>
<!--
        <tr>
            <td>Header color (alternate)</td>
            <td><span style="color: #93D7D7">#93D7D7</span>
                (<span style="color: #CBFAFA">#CBFAFA</span>)</td>
        </tr> -->
        <tr>
            <td>Background color for buttons, color for rulers</td>
            <td style="background-color: #349292; color: white">#349292</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Similar pages, by example all the country pages, will have the same design. Images will have the same size and look. </p>

    <h3>Fonts</h3>

    <p>Open Sans for the main body of text. It looks nice and is available through Google Fonts and frequently used, which means that the user probably has the font cached. For headings we use the “arvo” font. The serifs means it contrasts with the body text. It is a part of google font as well.</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>The logo will be a clickable link that will bring users back to the main page. The navbar will link to the different locations users can order package deals to.
        Links will be <span style="text-decoration: underline">underlined</span>, because of convention.</p>

    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p>On the main page the logo will be above the navbar, but on the other pages it will be a part of the navbar.</p>

    <h3>Navbar</h3>
    <p>At the front page, the navbar will be placed somewhat beneath the top of the page. At pages other than the front page, the navbar will be fixed at the top of the page. The navbar will indicate that an object is clickable, or show more options (locations), when the user is hovering over tabs in the navbar.</p>

    <h3>Footer</h3>
    <p>The footer will include a link to the site map of the page, and reference to the site creators (us).</p>

    <h3>Image/video</h3>
    <p>On the main page there will be a video in the background showing people skiing down mountains to entice users to make use of Snow4Days’ “awesome deals”.</p>

    <h3>Scaling</h3>
    <p>If project resources allow, the site will be made scalable for different screen sizes and devices. On bigger computer screens, the main body of the page will remain constant while pictures expand to fill the space.</p>


    <h2 id="6">6. Content</h2>
    <p>The website will consist of x separate pages as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Homepage - index.html</h3>
            <p>The homepage will be the startup site. This page will include a video of people skiing in one of our clients top locations, Telluride, to catch the user's attention. Furthermore the page will have an enlarged navbar compared to the other pages. Our clients logo will on this page be located on top of the navbar, and be larger than on the other sites.</p>
            <p>The amount of text on this page will be held to a minimum to prompt the user to use the navbar.</p>
            <p>We believe that this homepage will encourage the potential users explore the web page further and thereby purchase packages from our client. </p>

    <h2 id="7">7. Minimum Requirements for JavaScript</h2>

    <h3>Drop down menu</h3>
    <p>When hovering over a country in the navigation bar, locations in that country should be displayed underneath, allowing you jump directly to a specific location from any page. Only one such "drop down" should be displayed at any time. This will be implemented with JavaScript-code that hides the current drop-down and displays the correct one when "onMouseIn" activates, and hides the menu (or shows the one for the current page) once the mouse has left the menu area entirely.</p>

    <h3>Animations</h3>
    <p>When loading a page, some elements will fade in. Examples include background images that may take some time to load (so fade them in once they're ready). This can be implemented by changing the CSS opacity-property little by little.</p>

    <h3>Limit video playback to desktop and tablet</h3>
    <p>It would be bad if mobile users had to stream a video on the front page, eating up precious megabytes from their dataplan. Javascript could be used to hide/delete the Video element if the right conditions are met (or, alternatively only load the video if the right conditions are met).</p>

    <h3>Collapsing</h3>
    <p>In a FAQ-listing, individual questions will be listed, and the answer will be shown or hidden when clicking the corresponding question. This is different from the drop down menu since the pairs of questions and answers are independent from each other. JavaScript will take care of hiding or displaying the answer when clicking the question.</p>
