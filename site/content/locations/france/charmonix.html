            Chamonix is renowned as an extreme sports mecca, with some of the best powder fields in the world, and there’s plenty for those looking for their first off-piste experience too. But it’s not just the varied terrain that makes Chamonix a stand-out resort – it’s worth visiting just for the stunning views and year-round mountain town.
