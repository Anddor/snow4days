        <h2>France</h2>
        <p>The skiing on offer in France is, without doubt, some of the best and most extreme in the world - and French ski areas are certainly some of the biggest with many resorts lift-linked to a number of other resorts and all covered by one ski pass. Les Trois Vallées (the Three Valleys) is a prime example. Comprised of the resorts of Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens and Les Ménuires, the whole area has a massive 600km of pistes. France also has some of the best summer glacier skiing in Europe.<br>
The off-piste skiing and snowboarding in France is world famous. The French attitude, "if you want to ski off-piste it's OK with us, but on your head be it", means that there are none of the restrictive "out of bounds" policies that limit riders in North America. It's always best to take a guide though and you definitely should have safety equipment that you know how to use.
