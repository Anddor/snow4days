            St Anton is a big name resort, and there’s nowhere quite like it for those who like to ski hard. The place gets prodigious amounts of snow and usually has much better conditions than other resorts of a similar height. A bonus is that the resort is traditional in style and an attractive place to spend time off the slopes.

            The area boasts countless powder opportunities. The runs in the huge bowl beneath the summit of the Valluga are justifiably world-famous, and in good snow this whole area is an off-piste delight for experts. There’s more great backcountry in the Stuben sector and on the separate Rendl mountain (accessed from the town centre by a gondola). Descents of 1000m vertical are possible, including some on north-facing slopes where the powder stays deep and light.
