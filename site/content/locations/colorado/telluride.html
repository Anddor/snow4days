            The Telluride Ski Resort is located in the southwest corner of Colorado. The resort is in the southern San Juan Mountains, and is home to the highest concentration of 13,000 and 14,000 foot peaks in North America. Being one of the youngest mountain ranges in the country, the peaks and faces of the San Juan Mountains have not yet been worn down by weather and time thus providing scenic and dramatic landscape views.

            The top of resort features primarily expert and advanced terrain. The middle of the mountain offers plenty of cruisers and corduroy for intermediates and the lower/southwest side offer gentle runs where beginners can comfortably learn how to ski.
