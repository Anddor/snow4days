            <h2>Our Client</h2>
            <p>We have chosen to have an imaginary client for our project. </p>
            <p>Client Name: Snow4days Inc.<br>
                Contact person: Mike Hawke </p>
            <p>The client is a firm specializing in winter experiences around the world. They sell to travellers from several countries. They have no website, and want to have an online presence to reach more customers. </p>
    
            
            <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of the site is to get potential customers interested in buying an experience-pack from the snow4days company. To reach out to more potential customers, they want to have an online presence and be reachable through search engines, like Google or Yahoo. The website should make information accessible to visitors, and make them want to purchase travel experiences. </p>
            <p>For this reason the information should be presented in a easily digestible manner: easy to read sentences and pleasing graphical display. Fonts and colors should be chosen for readability, and navigation should be simple. The website should direct the visitor to purchasing possibilities: visiting address, email, and telephone.</p>
            
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Snow4Days delivers the total mountain experience. They are after skiers and snowboard riders with experience and preference for quality, and are willing to pay for it. They are passionate snow lovers, and they know what they want. </p>
            <p>The company is not after amateurs or those only there for the party. Therefore, the website should focus on the skiing experience. The company wants to show potential customers “extreme slopes”, and “unique lines”. </p>
